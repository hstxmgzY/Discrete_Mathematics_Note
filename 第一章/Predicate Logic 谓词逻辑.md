# Predicate Logic 谓词逻辑

## Predicate and Quantifiers 谓词和量词的概念

### Predicate 谓词

A predicate (**propositional function 命题函数**) is a statement that contains variables. 

Once the values of the variables are specified, the function has a truth value.

$P(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ n-place (n-ary) predicate **n位谓词（n元谓词）**

### Quantifiers 量词

+ Quantification expresses the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements.
+ **all, some, many, none, and few** are used in quantifications.

#### Universal Quantifier 全称量词

"For all"

$∀$

$∀x P(x)$ is read as "For all $x$, $P(x)$" or "For every $x$, $P(x)$"

> The universal quantification of P(x) create a proposition from a propositional function.

#### Existential Quantifier 存在量词

"There exists"

$∃$

$∃x P(x)$ is read as "For some $x$, $P(x)$", or as "There is an xsuch that $P(x)$", or "For at least one $x$, $P(x)$."

#### predicate calculus 谓词运算

The area of logic that deals with predicates and quantifiers is called the predicate calculus.

#### Properties of Quantifiers 量词性质

|   **Statement**    |            **When true?**             |            **When false?**             |
| :----------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| $$\forall x P(x)$$ |       P(x) is true for every x.       | There is an x for which P(x) is false. |
| $$\exists x P(x)$$ | There is an x for which P(x) is true. |       P(x) is false for every x.       |

#### Other Quantifiers 其他量词

 Uniqueness quantifier 唯一性量词

$\exists!$ or $\exists_1$

$∃!x P(x)$ means that P(x) is true for **one and only one x** in the universe of discourse.

#### *Loop 循环

When **the domain of discourse is finite**, we can think of quantification as **looping through the elements of the domain**.

1. To evaluate $∀x P(x)$ loop through all $x$ in the domain

   - If at every step $P(x)$ is true, then $∀x P(x)$ is true

   - If at a step $P(x)$ is false, then $∀x P(x)$ is false and the loop terminates


2. To evaluate $∃x P(x)$ loop through all xin the domain

   - If at some step, $P(x)$ is true, then $∃x P(x)$ is true and the loop terminates

   - If the loop ends without finding an $x$ for which $P(x)$ is true, then $∃x P(x)$ is false


> Even if the domains are infinite, we can still think of the quantifiers this fashion, but the loops will not terminate in some cases.

#### Quantifiers over Finite Domains

**Conjunctions and Disjunctions 合取、析取**

+ If the **domain is finite**, a universally quantified proposition is equivalent to **a conjunction of propositions** without quantifiers and an existentially quantified proposition is equivalent to **a disjunction of propositions** without quantifiers.

If U consists of the integers 1,2, and 3

$$\forall x P(x)\equiv P(1)\wedge P(2)\wedge P(3)$$

$$\exists x P(x)\equiv P(1)\vee P(2)\vee P(3)$$

> Even if the domains are infinite, you can still think of the quantifiers in this fashion, but the equivalent expressions without quantifiers will be infinitely long.



Eg.

> What do the statements $∀x<0(x^2 >0),∀y\ne 0(y^3\ne0),and\ ∃z>0(z^2 =2)$mean, where the domain in each case consists of the real numbers?
>
> + $∀x(x<0→x^2 >0)$.
>   + ”The square of a negative real number is positive.”
> + $∀y(y\ne0→y^3\ne0)$.
>   + ”The cube of every nonzero real number is nonzero.
> +  $∃z(z>0∧z^2 =2)$.
>   +  ”There is a positive square root of 2.”

#### Precedence of Quantifiers 量词优先级

The quantifiers $∀$  and $∃$  have **higher** precedence than **all the logical operators**.

eg.

> $$∀xP(x) ∨ Q(x)\to(∀xP(x))∨Q(x)$$

#### Binding Variables 量词绑定

##### Bound Variable 约束的量词
a variable is bound if it is known or quantified.

##### Free Variable 自由的量词

a variable neither quantified nor specified with a value

> All the variables that occur in a propositional function must be bound or set equal to a particular value to turn it into a proposition.

> In the statement $∃x(x + y = 1)$, the variable $x$ is bound by the existential quantification ∃x, but the variable y is free because it is not bound by a quantifier and no value is assigned to this variable. This illustrates that in the statement $∃x(x + y = 1)$, x is bound, but y is free.
>
> However, this statement is not a proposition since y is undefined and we can't tell whether it is true or false.
>
> 所以就是，约束就是1. 被量词约束，2. 被固定的值约束

## #Logical Equivalences Involving Quantifiers 涉及量词的逻辑等价式

Statements involving predicates and quantifiers are **logically equivalent** ***iff*** they have the same truth

x is not occuring in P

- 量词辖域的扩张

$$\forall xP(x)\vee A\equiv\forall x(P(x)\vee A)$$

$$\forall xP(x)\wedge A\equiv\forall x(P(x)\wedge A)$$

$$\exists xP(x)\vee A\equiv\exists x(P(x)\vee A)$$

$$\exists xP(x)\wedge A\equiv\exists x(P(x)\wedge A)$$

- 量词辖域的收缩

$$\forall x(A\to P(x))\equiv A\to\forall xP(x)$$

$$\exists x(A\to P(x))\equiv A\to\exists xP(x)$$

**（下面的两个式子很重要）**

$$\forall x(P(x)\to A)\equiv\exists xP(x)\to A$$

$$\exists x(P(x)\to A)\equiv\forall xP(x)\to A$$

Eg.

> if the first implication says that "if 𝑥 ends with a 0, then 𝑥 is a multiple of 5". The second implication would be "if **all** $x∈N$ end with a zero, then **all** 𝑥 are multiples of 5". Of course all $x∈N$ don't end with a 0, so the second implication is not useful, and, more importantly, not equivalent to the first one.

## Negating Quantified Expressions 量化表达式的否定

$$¬∀xP(x) ≡ ∃x¬P(x)$$

$$¬∃xQ(x) ≡ ∀x¬Q(x)$$

### De Morgan’s Laws for Quantifiers 量词的德·摩根律

|      **Negation**      | **Equivalent Statement** |      **When is Negation True?**       |           **When False?**            |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
| $$\neg\exists x P(x)$$ |  $$\forall x\neg P(x)$$  |       P(x) is false for every x       | There is an x for which P(x) is true |
| $$\neg\forall x P(x)$$ |  $$\exists x\neg P(x)$$  | There is an x for which P(x) is false |       P(x) is true for every x       |

## Translating from English into Logical Expressions

The very first step is to decide on the domain U.

> Translate the following sentence into predicate logic
> “Every student in this class has taken a course in Java.”
>
> **First decide on the domain U**.
>
> Solution 1
> If U is all students in this class, define a propositional function J(x) denoting “x has taken a course in Java” and translate as ∀x J(x).
>
> Solution 2
> But if U is all people, also define a propositional function S(x) denoting “x is a student in this class” and translate as ∀x (S(x)→ J(x)).

### A Very Important Notice!!!

1. Every student in this class has taken a course in Java

   if $U$ is all people, also define a propositional function $S(x)$ denoting “$x$ is a student in this class”

   $\forall x(S(x)\wedge J(x))$ is **not** correct!!!

   if there is **one** x that does not belong to this class, then **the whole statement is false**!

2. Some student in this class has taken a course in Java

   if U is all people

   $\exists x(S(x)\to J(x))$ is **not** correct!!!

   if there is **one** x that does not belong to this class, the **the whole statement is true**!

## Premises and Conclusion 前提和结论

Lewis Carroll Example

An argument

1. “All lions are fierce.”
2. “Some lions do not drink coffee.”
3. “Some fierce creatures do not drink coffee.”

The first two are called **premises**（**前提**） and the third is called the **conclusion**（**结论**）.The entire set is called an **argument**（论证）.

One way to translate these statements to predicate logic

Let p(x), q(x), and r(x) be the propositional functions “xis a lion,” “xis fierce,” and “xdrinks coffee,” respectively. Domain of x: All creatures.
1. $∀x (p(x)→ q(x))$
2. $∃x (p(x) ∧¬r(x))$
3. $∃x (q(x) ∧¬r(x))$

Later we will see how to prove that the conclusion follows from the premises.

# Nested Quantifiers 嵌套量词

## Definition 定义

Two quantifiers are nested if one is within the scope of the other.

e.g. 

+ $∃y∀xQ(x, y)$: “There is a real number y such that for every real number x, Q(x, y).”
+ $∀x∃yQ(x, y)$: “For every real number x there is a real number y such that Q(x, y).”



## Quantifications of Two Variables 两个变量的量化式

|                        Statement                         |                      When True?                      |                      When False?                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
| $$\forall x\forall yP(x, y)\\\forall y\forall xP(x, y)$$ |         P(x, y) is true for every pair x, y.         |   There is a pair x, y for which P(x, y) is false.    |
|              $$\forall x\exists yP(x, y)$$               | For every x there is a y for which P(x, y) is true.  | There is an x such that P(x, y) is false for every y. |
|              $$\exists x\forall yP(x, y)$$               | There is an x for which P(x, y) is true for every y. | For every x there is a y for which P(x, y) is false.  |
| $$\exists x\exists yP(x, y)\\\exists y\exists xP(x, y)$$ |   There is a pair x, y for which P(x, y) is true.    |         P(x, y) is false for every pair x, y.         |

## Translating Mathematical Statements

1. Translate “The sum of two positive integers is always positive”into a logic expression.

> $ ∀x∀y((x > 0)∧(y > 0) → (x+y > 0)).$

2.  Use quantifiers to express the definition of the limit of a real-valued function $f(x)$

   $$lim_{x→a} f(x) = L$$

>  $∀ε > 0∃δ > 0∀x(0 < |x − a| < δ → |f(x) − L| < ε)$

## #Translating English Sentence

1. If a person is female and is a parent, then this person is someone’s mother.

>  - F(x) to represent “x is female.”
> - P(x) to represent “x is a parent.”
> - M(x, y) to represent “x is the mother of y.”
> - $∀x((F(x) ∧ P(x)) → ∃yM(x, y))$



2. Express the statement “Everyone has exactly one best friend” as a logical expression with a domain consisting of all people

>  *Solution*
>
> Rewrite the original statement as **For every person *x* , *x* has exactly one best friend.**
>
> There is a person ***y*** who is the best friend of ***x***, and furthermore, that for every person ***z***, if ***z*** is not ***y***, then ***z*** is not the best friend of ***x***.
>
> Let *B*(*x, y*) be the statement *y* is the best friend of *x*.
>
> $$\forall x\exists y\forall z(B(x,y)\wedge((z≠y)\to\neg B(x,z)))$$



3.  “There is a woman who has taken a flight on every airline in the world.”

> *Solution1*
>
>  - $P(w, f)$: “w has taken f.”
> - $Q(f,a)$: “f is a flight on a.” 
> - $∃w∀a∃f(P(w,f)∧Q(f,a))$.

## Translating from Nested Quantifiers into English 

> Translate the statement $\forall x(C(x)\wedge \exists y(C(y)\wedge F(x,y)))$ into English, where C(x) is "x has a computer," F(x,y) is "x and y are friends," and the domain for both x and y consists of all students at ZJU. 
>
> *Solution*
>
> 1. Use **variables** in the translatint result (Easy and clear)
>
>    For every student ***x*** at ZJU, ***x*** has a computer or there is a student ***y*** such that ***y*** has a computer and ***x*** and ***y*** are friends.
>
> 2. Understand the **meaning** and **report** it in English
>
>    Every student at ZJU has a computer or has a friend who has a computer.

## The Order of Quantifiers 量词顺序

The order of nested quantifiers **matters** if quantifiers are of **different types**

e.g.

$$\forall x\forall yP(x,y)\equiv\forall y\forall xP(x,y)$$

However

$$\exists x\forall yP(x,y)$$ is not the same as $$\forall y\exists xP(x,y)$$

> **Explanation**
>
> Assume P(*x*,*y*) denote "*x* loves *y*", where the domain for variables *x* and *y* consists of all people
>
> $$\exists x\forall yP(x,y)$$ --> There is someone who loves everyone.
>
> $$\forall y\exists xP(x,y)$$ --> Everybody is loved by somebody.

## Negating Nested Quantifiers 嵌套量词的否定

Negating nested quantifiers by successively applying the rules for negating statements involving a single quantifier
